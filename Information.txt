Developing the game logic -

Card War Game
A deck of 52 cards are taken
Divide the cards into 2 players-26 cards each
Both will show a Card and the Card with higher ranking wins and winner takes both cards.
Player loses of there are no more cards remaining with any player
If both the cards are of exact same value the game continues and the higher card player will take all the cards.
4 classes will be used-
Card class
Deck class
Player class
